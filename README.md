# C++ project

This repository contains a C++ program that functions as a dynamic tournament scoreboard. Developed to practice fundamental data structures and algorithms, this application uses a struct to manage team data (name, wins, losses, draws, points) and a std::vector to hold the collection of teams. It takes user input, calculates points, and then employs the std::sort algorithm with a custom comparison function to rank the teams. The final output is a neatly formatted leaderboard displayed in the console.
